# About Me

Iâ€™m a Northern Virginia-based software engineer currently working at Capital One HQ. My skillset includes the following technologies:

- Javascript
- Node
- React
- Svelte
- Gatsby
- Next
- AWS Lambdas
- AWS Step Functions
- AWS EC2
- AWS Cognito
- AWS DynamoDB
- AWS SQS
- AWS Amplify
- AWS Cloudwatch
- AWS Route 53
- MongoDB
- SQL
- Tailwind
- Urbit

Urbit is my primary personal programming interest. I run [geturbitid.com](https://www.geturbitid.com), the first hosting service for Urbit IDs. You can find me on the Urbit network as `~panmut-solneb`.

Outside of programming, my main hobbies are classical music, literature, math, physics (especially SETI), and travel.
